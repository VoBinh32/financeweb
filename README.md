In this project, I just built a stock website where:
<br>
    - Users will be able to register for the website(new users will receive $10,000 in cash).
  <br>
    - Then log in using their username and password.

    <br>
    - Once they log in, they will be able to look up a stockâ€™s current price.
    <br>
    - It enables a user to buy stocks and sell their own stocks.
    <br>
    - The users can see theirs index page and history of transactions and can add money to their account too.
